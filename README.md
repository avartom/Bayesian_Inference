# Bayesian Inference

In this project, we're going to practice calculating conditional probabilities. We will use Python and the pandas cross tabulation method to look at various survival scenarios. After we complete the Titanic calculations, we'll visit the Harry Potter Universe and apply what we learned to the Sorting Hat situation at Hogwarts (a detailed description of the problem is provided - no need to have any familiarity with the Harry Potter books or movies).
